anjea [backup|vault|list|help]

  anjea_backup uses rsync to synchronize files.
  It uses hard links which are suitable for large sets of small, changing files.
  Hard links are not very suitable for large files, as a single changed byte
  will lead to a full copy of that file.

  Configuration takes place in two files, anjea.conf and backup.conf .
  See the README for details.
